    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is really special for me, because my <code>Macbook Air 13"</code> is already one year old. I remember that I felt unforgettable as soon as I touched her. I also remember that why did I think she is the one for me, do you want to know why?</p>

<p>Because of <code>Ruby on Rails</code>. I would like to learn that since I visited <a href="http://blog.xdite.net/">this blog</a>. Those posts show me how wonderful Rails is, its porpose is to create websites, that&rsquo;s what I want!</p>

<p>Few days later, I bought the the famous Rails developer, xdite, her book <a href="https://leanpub.com/rails-101">Rails 101 (It&rsquo;s free now)</a>. I impressed by a part of paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mac 是最好的 Ruby on Rails 開發環境，馬上買一台！</p></blockquote>

<p>So I got Macbook immediatrly. I am easy to be incfuenced by someone, but I do not regret to do this. I think this pricy stuff can make money for me soon. But such a pitty, I did not try my best to learn Rails in the last year.</p>

<p>Now, I want to recreate my ambition. I am going to write down my thoughts of learning techniques here to train my writing skill. That&rsquo;s why I spend afternoon to build this blog using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, you can follow <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">Octopress documentation</a> to create it. If you have no idea why you must create a blog and insist on blogging, I believe <a href="http://zenhabits.net/write-daily/">Why You Should Write Daily</a> may help you much.</p>

<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s blog!</p>
